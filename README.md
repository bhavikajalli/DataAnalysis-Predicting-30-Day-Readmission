# DataAnalysis-R-30DayReadmittance

The aim of the classifier is to predict the 30-day Hospital Readmission of Diabetic Patients. This is a very interesting question as it affects many stakeholders including 
- Physicians (for managed care and healthier patients)
- Patients themselves for better quality of care and disease management
- Insurance companies for reduced costs
- Policy Makers as they can create incentive-based policy for better overall care

A successful model will
- Identify patients who may need support / monitoring after being discharged
- May reduce 30-day readmission rate
- Outpatient interventions for high-risk patients may save resources and may result in better outcomes
